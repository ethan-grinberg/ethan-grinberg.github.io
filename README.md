# Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio site built in Vue and Vuetify. 

It also has a feature to extract my notes from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) into a structured JSON to populate my site. This isn't a general-purpose feature yet as it's specific to how my notes are structured but feel free to adapt it to your notes/project. It makes website content management very easy as you don't need to edit the front end to update the website content.



## Project setup

```
npm install
```

## Development
```
npm run dev
```
## Build
```
npm run build
```

## Run Python Script to convert notes to JSON

python export_content.py
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
