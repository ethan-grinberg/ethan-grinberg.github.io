With economic, social, and political implications, researchers have directed their attention to ways in which this problem can be understood and solved. Recent work has shown that articles from misleading sources can be told apart from mainstream sources by the topology of their Twitter diffusion networks. This project expands on these findings by attempting to answer the question: can the diffusion networks of misinformation articles reveal a set of ways in which misinformation spreads on social media? To accomplish this, the Twitter diffusion networks of over 700 articles from low credibility sources were converted to embeddings using the UGraphEmb graph embedding algorithm and clustered using k-means clustering. From here the differences in topological features of diffusion networks belonging to different clusters will be analyzed and explained. The hope is to use these results to better inform social media policy and algorithm design.", "contributions": ["Implemented cutting-edge unsupervised graph embedding algorithm in Networkx and TensorFlow to convert complex networks of misinformation diffusion to embeddings", "Utilized K-means clustering with Sklearn to identify previously unseen patterns in diffusion of misinformation, providing valuable insights for understanding and combating spread of false information", "Created poster to present findings at UIUC Undergraduate Research Symposium for which Outstanding Poster Presentation in Numbers Data And Computation was earned"], "links": [{"text": "github", "url": "https://github.com/ethanbg2/misinformation-cluster-analysis"}, {"text": "Poster", "url": "https://github.com/ethanbg2/misinformation-cluster-analysis/blob/master/reports/poster/ug_symposium_poster_2022.pdf"}, {"text": "Poster Presentation Award", "url": "https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6204/678500770"}, {"text": "College Blog Post", "url": "https://media.illinois.edu/media-students-present-2022-undergraduate-research-symposium"}, {"text": "Image of Research", "url": "https://publish.illinois.edu/imageofresearch/undergraduate-image-of-research/2022-undergraduate-entries/"}]}, {"type": "Web App", "name": "Melodic Eyes", "date": "2022-08-01 - 2023-04-01", "skills": ["Python", "Vue.js", "Microservice Architecture", "cPanel", "Tone.js", "Javascript", "Pillow", "Apache", "Flask", "Figma"], "images": ["melodic-eyes/demo.png", "melodic-eyes/home.png", "melodic-eyes/action.png"], "description": "Experience art and music in a whole new way!
